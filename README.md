# Logo-Generator

## Description

I will be entering the world of coding very soon, and there is a chance I will be doing freelance work. I want to be able to create logos for myself. That way I will not have to pay a graphic designer. Through creating this appilcation, I began to understand how to use node.js  and some of the advantages of various dependencies. I used various classes, test files, and js files to take input from a user and create a logo. I also became more comfortable with the terminal, adding in client responses with inquirer, while also running new commands to run tests with jest. Overall I am getting better and working towards being able to run an application as a server on my own computer.

## Installation

Node.js

On Node.js, install inquirer as a dependency, and jest as a dev dependency

## Usage

A user will open the application, and go to the terminal off of the index.js file. If it is their first time, they will need to run "npm i" to install inquirer as a dependency and jest as a dev dependency. Afterwards they can input "npm run test" to make sure all of the files pass the test.js tests (which they should). Then they will run "node index.js" to run the application. It will then ask them a series of questions, including what title, text, text-color, shape, and shape-color they would like for their logo. After finishing the questions, and new svg document will be creted in the examples folder, and they can open it to see how their logo looks.
